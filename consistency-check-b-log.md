# Consistency Check B - Test Log
*Phase 2A: Core Systems Addition*

## Test Scope
Validating foundation rules integration: State-Based Actions, Mulligan procedures, Face-down permanents, Combat timing standardization, and minor issue fixes from Check A.

## 1v1 Core Tests

### Face-Down Interactions with Type-Specific Effects  
**Scenario**: Player has face-down creature (2/2 colorless). Opponent plays "Destroy target Beast creature."

**Face-Down Rules Test**:
- Face-down permanent has no creature types
- "Destroy target Beast" cannot target face-down creature (not a Beast)
- Face-down can be targeted by "Destroy target creature" (is a creature)
- **PASS**: Type-specific targeting works correctly with face-down rules

**Result**: ✅ PASS - Face-down interactions properly implemented

### Combat Timing with Fast Creatures and Combat Tricks
**Scenario**: 3/3 Fast creature attacks, blocked by 2/2 normal creature. Defending player has instant-speed pump spell.

**Combat Timing Test**:
- Declare Blockers step: 2/2 blocks 3/3 Fast
- First Damage Step: 3/3 Fast deals 3 damage, 2/2 deals 2 damage (simultaneously)
- State-based actions: 2/2 destroyed (3+ damage), 3/3 survives
- Priority window: Defender cannot pump the already-dead 2/2
- Second Damage Step: No remaining creatures
- **PASS**: Fast combat timing prevents impossible combat tricks

**Result**: ✅ PASS - Combat timing prevents illegal instant responses during damage

### State-Based Actions with Complex Board States
**Scenario**: Multiple triggers happening simultaneously across different SBA categories.

**SBA Integration Test**:
- Creature with 4 damage and 4 defense gets -1/-1 counter (now 3/3 with 4 damage)
- Player draws from empty library
- Win condition triggers from creature dying
- **SBA Resolution**: 
  1. Counter applied (3/3 with 4 damage)
  2. Creature destroyed (damage ≥ defense)
  3. Player loses (library depletion)
  4. Win condition irrelevant (player already lost)
- **PASS**: Multiple SBA handled in correct order

**Result**: ✅ PASS - State-based actions resolve correctly in complex situations

### Mulligan Impact on Archetype Consistency
**Scenario**: Each archetype's opening hand quality with new mulligan rules.

**Mulligan Balance Test**:
- Iron Assembly: Needs early artifacts - benefits from 2 free Limited mulligans
- Embercore: Needs low-cost creatures - 1 free Standard mulligan sufficient  
- Verdant: Needs defensive tools - benefits from scry after additional mulligans
- Silent: Needs information tools - benefits from seeing more cards
- **PASS**: No archetype disproportionately helped or hurt

**Result**: ✅ PASS - Mulligan rules don't create archetype imbalance

## 2v2 Multiplayer Tests

### State-Based Actions with Multiple Players
**Scenario**: Complex board state affects multiple players simultaneously.

**Multiplayer SBA Test**:
- Player A has creature that dies, triggering global effect
- Player B has 10 cards in exile, should lose
- Player C has win condition triggering from Player A's creature death
- Player D controls legend that conflicts with Player A's legend
- **SBA Resolution Order**:
  1. All SBA identified simultaneously
  2. Player B loses (exile count)
  3. Legend rule resolved by controllers
  4. Win condition checked (Player C wins if still valid)
- **PASS**: Multiplayer SBA timing works correctly

**Result**: ✅ PASS - Multiplayer state-based actions resolved properly

### Face-Down Permanent Targeting in Multiplayer
**Scenario**: Effects that target "each creature" or global creature effects with face-down permanents.

**Global Effect Test**:
- "All creatures get +1/+1": Face-down creatures become 3/3
- "Each player sacrifices a creature": Face-down can be chosen
- "Destroy all Beasts": Face-down survives (not a Beast)
- **PASS**: Global effects interact correctly with face-down

**Result**: ✅ PASS - Face-down rules work consistently in multiplayer

### Combat with Multiple Defending Players
**Scenario**: Fast creatures attacking different opponents.

**Fast Combat Multiplayer Test**:
- Player A attacks Players B and C with Fast creatures
- Each defender declares blocks separately
- First damage step affects both combats simultaneously
- Priority given to all players between damage steps
- **PASS**: Fast combat timing consistent across multiple combats

**Result**: ✅ PASS - Combat timing works in multiplayer scenarios

## Mechanical Focus Areas

### Face-Down + All Keyword Interactions
**Test Matrix**: Face-down creatures with various keyword abilities.

**Keyword Interaction Tests**:
- Face-down + Aura targeting: Aura sees 2/2 colorless creature
- Face-down + Clone effects: Clone copies face-down 2/2 status
- Face-down + Transform: Cannot transform while face-down
- Face-down + Sacrifice effects: Can be sacrificed as "creature"
- Face-down + Death triggers: Reveals briefly, triggers use actual card
- **PASS**: All interactions defined and consistent

**Result**: ✅ PASS - Face-down interactions comprehensive and consistent

### Combat Timing with All Creature Abilities
**Comprehensive Combat Test**: Every creature ability with Fast combat timing.

**Ability Timing Tests**:
- Fast + Double Strike: Deals damage in both first and second steps
- Fast + Deadly: First damage step kills with any damage
- Fast + Armored: Prevents damage in first step
- Fast + Lifelink: Life gained during first damage step
- Fast + Triggers: "When deals damage" triggers after first step
- **PASS**: All abilities work correctly with two-step damage

**Result**: ✅ PASS - Fast combat compatible with all creature abilities

### State-Based Action Ordering and Priority
**Complex Timing Test**: Multiple SBA with priority interactions.

**Priority Integration Test**:
- SBA performed before any player gets priority
- If SBA creates triggers, players get priority to respond to triggers
- After trigger resolution, SBA checked again
- Process repeats until no SBA needed
- **PASS**: SBA timing integrates properly with priority system

**Result**: ✅ PASS - State-based actions integrated with priority correctly

### Cost Reduction Stacking with New Rules
**Test Case**: Assembly Line + Affinity + Convoke interaction.

**Stacking Calculation Test**:
- 8 EP artifact with Assembly Line (4 EP reduction cap)
- Affinity for artifacts with 3 artifacts (3 EP additional reduction)  
- Convoke tapping 2 creatures (2 EP additional reduction)
- **Calculation**: 8 - 4 (Assembly cap) - 3 (Affinity) - 2 (Convoke) = -1, minimum 1 EP
- **Final Cost**: 1 EP
- **PASS**: All reductions stack properly with defined caps

**Result**: ✅ PASS - Cost reduction stacking works as defined

## Contradiction Hunt

### Foundation Rules vs Existing Interactions
**Cross-Reference Check**: New foundation rules vs existing card interactions.

**Integration Analysis**:
- SBA timing vs win condition checking: Win conditions now in SBA list
- Face-down rules vs creature type interactions: Properly defined as no types
- Combat timing vs existing Fast creatures: Standardized consistently
- Mulligan rules vs archetype balance: No contradictions found
- **PASS**: Foundation rules integrate cleanly

**Result**: ✅ PASS - No contradictions between foundation and existing rules

### Intel Timing vs Priority System Integration
**Detailed Check**: Intel spending and priority interaction.

**Intel Priority Test**:
- Intel abilities follow normal instant/sorcery speed restrictions
- Spending Intel tokens doesn't use stack (like spending EP)
- The ability bought with Intel uses stack and priority normally
- Players can respond to Intel abilities after they're announced
- **PASS**: Intel fully integrated with priority system

**Result**: ✅ PASS - Intel timing issues from Check A resolved

### Tournament vs Casual Rule Differences
**Format Consistency Check**: Different mulligan rules across formats.

**Format Rule Analysis**:
- Standard: 1 free mulligan + scry system clearly defined
- Competitive: Paris mulligan system clearly defined  
- Limited: 2 free mulligans clearly defined
- No contradictions between formats
- **PASS**: All formats have clear, distinct procedures

**Result**: ✅ PASS - Format differences clearly defined without conflicts

- All creature destruction covered (damage, 0 defense)
- All attachment issues covered (illegal auras)
- Counter interactions covered (+1/+1 vs -1/-1)
- Uniqueness rules covered (legends, planeswalkers)
- **PASS**: SBA list comprehensive for current mechanics

**Result**: ✅ PASS - State-based actions comprehensive

### Mulligan Procedure Clarity

- Multiplayer: Simultaneous decision process
- **PASS**: All procedures clear and tournament-viable

**Result**: ✅ PASS - Mulligan procedures clear and practical
