# Batch 3 Comprehensive Plan - Tournament Completion

## Strategic Analysis & Mechanical Innovation

### Current State Assessment

#### Existing Mechanics Framework
**Core Resource Systems:**
- **Energy Points (EP)** - Primary resource with pitch system
- **Intel Tokens** - Information resource with escalating costs (1st normal, 2nd +2, 3rd +4)
- **Growth Counters** - Scaling resource with 3+ threshold effects
- **Risk Dice** - d20 system with graduated thresholds (6+/11+/16+/19+)

**Combat & Timing Systems:**
- **Fast Combat** - Two-step damage resolution
- **State-Based Actions** - Continuous game state checking
- **Trap System** - Face-down permanents (2 max per player)
- **Win Conditions** - Alternative victory mechanisms

**Archetype-Specific Mechanics:**
- **Assembly Line** (Iron) - Artifact cost reduction (4 EP cap)

### New Mechanics Design

#### Mechanic Selection Criteria
1. **Archetype Enhancement** - Amplifies existing identity without dilution
2. **Rules Integration** - Works seamlessly with existing systems
3. **Strategic Depth** - Creates meaningful decision points
4. **Power Level Appropriate** - Maintains established balance
5. **Implementation Clarity** - Unambiguous rules text

#### Proposed New Mechanics

### 1. Overcharge (Embercore Legion)
**Concept**: Pay additional EP for enhanced effects
**Rules**: "Overcharge X: You may pay X additional EP as you cast this spell. If you do, [enhanced effect]"
**Integration**: 
- Works with existing EP system
- Scales with Assembly Line cost reduction
- Compatible with pitch system
- Respects minimum 1 EP cost rules

**Design Examples**:
- Lightning Bolt: 2 EP, deal 3 damage. Overcharge 2: Deal 5 damage instead
- Flame Warrior: 3 EP 3/2. Overcharge 1: Gets +2/+0 and Fast

### 2. Threshold (Verdant Coil)
**Concept**: Enhanced effects when graveyard has 7+ cards
**Rules**: "Threshold - If seven or more cards are in your graveyard, [enhanced effect]"
**Integration**:
- Works with pitch system (creates natural graveyard buildup)
- Complements Growth counter strategy (different resource axis)
- Compatible with state-based actions
- Encourages resource management decisions

**Design Examples**:
- Forest Guardian: 4 EP 3/5. Threshold: Gets +2/+2 and Cultivate 2
- Natural Recursion: 2 EP, return target card. Threshold: Return 2 cards instead

### 3. Channel (Silent Mantle)
**Concept**: Discard for alternate effect instead of casting
**Rules**: "Channel - EP Cost, Discard ~: [Effect]. Channel only as a sorcery"
**Integration**:
- Works with pitch system (additional discard outlet)
- Enhances trap strategy (more hand manipulation)
- Compatible with Intel generation
- Respects sorcery timing restrictions

**Design Examples**:
- Shadow Strike: 3 EP instant, destroy creature. Channel 1: Target creature gets -2/-2
- Phantom Assassin: 4 EP 3/2. Channel 2: Deal 3 damage to any target

### 4. Salvage (Iron Assembly)
**Concept**: Benefits when artifacts enter graveyard
**Rules**: "Salvage - Whenever an artifact is put into a graveyard from play, [effect]"
**Integration**:
- Works with Assembly Line (more artifacts = more triggers)
- Compatible with sacrifice-based strategies
- Doesn't conflict with existing mechanics
- Creates value from artifact destruction

**Design Examples**:
- Scrap Collector: 2 EP 2/1. Salvage: Put a +1/+1 counter on ~
- Reclamation Engine: 4 EP artifact. Salvage: Create a 1/1 Servo token

### 5. Universal Mechanic: Cycle
**Concept**: Pay EP, discard: Draw a card
**Rules**: "Cycle EP: You may pay EP and discard this card to draw a card"
**Integration**:
- Works across all archetypes
- Enhances deck consistency
- Compatible with pitch system
- Provides universal card selection

## Batch 3 Card Distribution

## Power Level Maintenance Strategy

### Cost Efficiency Standards (Maintained from Batches 1-2)
- **1 EP**: 1-2 power, 1-3 toughness + minor ability
- **2 EP**: 2-3 power, 1-4 toughness + utility OR 3-4 damage spell
- **3 EP**: 3-4 power, 2-5 toughness + synergy OR significant effect
- **4+ EP**: Threats that can impact games or powerful effects

### New Mechanic Costing Guidelines

#### Overcharge Costing
- **Base Effect**: Standard for EP cost
- **Overcharge Cost**: 1-2 EP for meaningful upgrade
- **Overcharge Benefit**: 50-100% improvement over base

#### Threshold Costing
- **Base Effect**: Slightly under-costed for EP
- **Threshold Benefit**: 30-50% improvement when active
- **Activation Requirement**: 7+ cards in graveyard (achievable turn 4-6)

#### Channel Costing
- **Spell Mode**: Standard costing
- **Channel Mode**: 1-2 EP cheaper with reduced effect
- **Channel Effect**: 60-80% of spell mode power

#### Salvage Costing
- **Base Stats**: Standard for EP cost
- **Salvage Trigger**: Minor to moderate benefit per trigger
- **Trigger Frequency**: 1-3 times per game expected

## Rules Integration Validation

### New Rules Required

#### Overcharge Rules
```
- Overcharge is an additional cost that can be paid as you cast the spell
- If Assembly Line or other cost reductions apply, calculate Overcharge based on the reduced cost
- Overcharge effects are part of the spell and can't be responded to separately
- If the spell is countered, the Overcharge cost is still paid
```

#### Threshold Rules
```
- Threshold abilities are continuous effects that apply when condition is met
- Cards in all graveyards count toward threshold (including opponent's)
- Threshold status is checked continuously by state-based actions
- If threshold status changes during resolution, abilities update immediately
```

#### Channel Rules
```
- Channel is an alternative way to use a card instead of casting it
- Channel abilities can only be activated at sorcery speed
- Channeling a card puts it directly into your graveyard
- Channel costs can't be reduced by cost reduction effects
- Channel abilities don't count as casting spells
```

#### Salvage Rules
```
- Salvage triggers whenever any artifact enters any graveyard from play
- Multiple Salvage abilities trigger from the same event
- Salvage abilities use the stack and can be responded to
- Token artifacts trigger Salvage when they are destroyed (before ceasing to exist)
```

### Existing System Compatibility

#### Intel Token System
- **New mechanics don't generate Intel** (preserves Silent Mantle identity)
- **Overcharge doesn't affect Intel costs** (different resource axis)
- **Channel provides alternative Intel spending** (enhances existing strategy)

#### Assembly Line System
- **Overcharge calculated after cost reduction** (maintains balance)
- **Salvage triggered by Assembly Line artifacts** (creates synergy)
- **New artifacts respect 4 EP reduction cap** (preserves balance)

#### Growth Counter System
- **Threshold doesn't interact with Growth** (separate resource axis)
- **New mechanics can distribute Growth** (maintains archetype identity)
- **3+ counter threshold unchanged** (preserves existing cards)

#### Risk Dice System
- **New mechanics can include Risk effects** (maintains Embercore identity)
- **Overcharge doesn't affect Risk thresholds** (separate systems)
- **Natural 20/1 effects still universal** (preserves existing rules)

## Strategic Diversity Enhancement

### Multi-Archetype Strategies

#### Overcharge + Assembly Line (Embercore/Iron)
- **Concept**: Cost reduction enables bigger Overcharge payments
- **Cards**: Cross-archetype artifacts with Overcharge abilities
- **Strategy**: Explosive turns with reduced costs and enhanced effects

#### Threshold + Salvage (Verdant/Iron)
- **Concept**: Artifact sacrifice enables Threshold while triggering Salvage
- **Cards**: Artifacts that sacrifice themselves for Cultivate effects
- **Strategy**: Graveyard buildup while gaining immediate value

#### Channel + Intel (Silent/Universal)
- **Concept**: Channel abilities that generate or spend Intel
- **Cards**: Creatures with Channel: Create Intel tokens
- **Strategy**: Information warfare through alternative resource paths

### Alternative Win Conditions

#### Embercore Alternatives
1. **Overcharge Mastery**: Win if you Overcharge 5+ times in one game
2. **Explosive Finale**: Win if you deal 15+ damage in a single turn

#### Verdant Alternatives  
1. **Natural Dominance**: Win if you control 10+ permanents with different names
2. **Threshold Mastery**: Win if you maintain Threshold for 3 consecutive turns

#### Silent Alternatives
1. **Information Superiority**: Win if you've used Channel abilities 8+ times
2. **Master Manipulator**: Win by controlling opponent's next turn (existing)

#### Iron Alternatives
1. **Salvage Economy**: Win if Salvage abilities have triggered 12+ times
2. **Mechanical Perfection**: Win if you control 8+ artifacts with different EP costs
