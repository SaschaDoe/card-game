# Batch 2 Design Plan - Synergy & Counter-Strategy

## Design Priorities

### Primary Goals (Based on Batch 1 Feedback)
1. **Silent Mantle Synergy Density** - Add 2-3 more Intel/trap synergy cards
2. **Ignition Enabler Expansion** - Add 2-3 more Ignition-matters cards for Trinity of Flames viability
3. **Counter-Strategy Development** - Add answers for each archetype's dominant strategies
4. **Consistency Enablers** - Add deck manipulation and tutoring effects

### Secondary Goals
1. **Alternative Win Conditions** - Secondary victory paths for each archetype
2. **Hybrid Exploration** - Begin cross-archetype synergy cards
3. **Sideboard Options** - Meta-game responses and flexible answers
4. **Power Level Maintenance** - No power creep over Batch 1 foundation

## Batch 2 Card Distribution

### Target: 40 Cards Total (10 per archetype)

#### Embercore Legion (10 cards)
- **Priority**: Ignition enablers and consistency
- **3 Ignition Cards**: More ways to enable and reward Ignition
- **2 Consistency Cards**: Card selection and deck manipulation
- **2 Counter-Answers**: Ways to fight control and disruption
- **2 Alternative Threats**: Non-creature damage sources
- **1 Sideboard Option**: Flexible meta-game card

#### Verdant Coil (10 cards)
- **Priority**: Instant-speed options and non-creature Growth targets
- **3 Growth Enablers**: More ways to distribute Growth counters
- **2 Instant-Speed Cards**: Flash creatures and instant Growth
- **2 Non-Creature Targets**: Artifacts/enchantments that benefit from Growth
- **2 Defensive Tools**: Better early game survival
- **1 Alternative Win Condition**: Non-Growth victory path

#### Silent Mantle (10 cards)
- **Priority**: Intel synergy and trap variety
- **4 Intel/Trap Synergy**: Address the synergy density gap
- **2 Trap Varieties**: New trap types and interactions
- **2 Intel Spending**: More ways to convert Intel to advantage
- **1 Information Amplifier**: Enhance information warfare effects
- **1 Alternative Win Condition**: Non-trap victory path

#### Iron Assembly (10 cards)
- **Priority**: Non-creature artifacts and alternative strategies
- **3 Non-Creature Artifacts**: Lands, equipment, engines
- **2 Assembly Line Alternatives**: Different cost reduction approaches
- **2 Artifact Protection**: Ways to protect key artifacts
- **2 Alternative Strategies**: Non-combo artifact approaches
- **1 Sideboard Option**: Anti-artifact hate card

## Specific Card Concepts

### Embercore Legion - Ignition Focus

#### Ignition Enablers
1. **Ignition Catalyst** (2 EP Enchantment)
   - All creatures have "Pay 2 EP: This creature gains Ignition until end of turn"
   - Makes Trinity of Flames more achievable

2. **Flame Conduit** (1 EP Artifact Creature)
   - 1/1, When ~ dies, target creature gains Ignition until end of turn
   - Enables Ignition through sacrifice

3. **Ignition Master** (4 EP Creature)
   - 3/3, When ~ enters play, all creatures you control gain Ignition until end of turn
   - One-card Ignition enabler for multiple creatures

### Silent Mantle - Synergy Density

#### Intel/Trap Synergies
1. **Intel Network** (2 EP Enchantment)
   - Whenever you create Intel, create an additional Intel
   - Doubles Intel generation rate

2. **Trap Master** (3 EP Creature)
   - 2/3, When ~ enters play, search library for a trap and put it into play face-down
   - Enables immediate trap synergies

3. **Information Warfare** (4 EP Sorcery)
   - Spend X Intel: Draw X cards, then set X traps
   - Major Intel sink with immediate board impact

4. **Surveillance Network** (1 EP Artifact)
   - Sacrifice: Look at opponent's hand and create 2 Intel
   - Cheap repeatable information source

### Counter-Strategy Development

#### Anti-Embercore
- **Heat Sink** (Iron Assembly): Artifact that prevents damage to artifacts
- **Flame Retardant** (Verdant Coil): Enchantment that reduces damage

#### Anti-Verdant
- **Entropy Field** (Silent Mantle): Remove all counters from target permanent
- **Controlled Burn** (Embercore): Deal damage equal to Growth counters

#### Anti-Silent
- **Truth Serum** (Verdant Coil): Reveal all face-down cards
- **Information Blackout** (Iron Assembly): Prevent information gathering

#### Anti-Iron
- **Rust Storm** (Embercore): Destroy all artifacts with EP cost X or less
- **Natural Decay** (Verdant Coil): Destroy target artifact, gain Growth counters

## Power Level Guidelines

### Cost Efficiency Maintenance
- 1 EP creatures: 1-2 power, 1-3 toughness + minor ability
- 2 EP spells: 3-4 value equivalent + minor upside
- Win conditions: 4-8 EP with specific requirements

### Synergy Reward Standards
- Synergy cards should provide 20-30% efficiency bonus when requirements met
- No single card should enable game-winning combos alone
- All synergies should require 2+ cards minimum

### Counter-Strategy Balance
- Answers should be situational, not universal
- Counter-cards should have reasonable costs (not free)
- No single card should shut down entire archetypes

## Consistency Check Criteria

### Rules Integration
- All new mechanics integrate with existing state-based actions
- Face-down cards follow established rules
- Combat timing respects Fast creature interactions
- Intel escalation costs properly applied

### Power Level Validation
- No card significantly over/under-powered vs Batch 1 baseline
- Win conditions remain achievable in 6-10 turns
- No infinite combos or game-breaking interactions

### Strategic Coherence
- Each archetype maintains distinct identity
- New cards enhance existing themes without dilution
- Cross-archetype interactions create meaningful decisions
- Meta-game answers available without format warping

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Targets
- Silent Mantle synergy pairs: 10+ (up from 6)
- Ignition interaction cards: 6+ total (up from 3)
- Counter-strategy options: 2+ per archetype weakness
- Alternative win conditions: 1+ per archetype

### Qualitative Goals
- Increased strategic diversity within each archetype
- More meaningful sideboard and meta-game decisions
- Enhanced replay value through varied game patterns
- Maintained competitive balance across all archetypes

## Implementation Sequence

1. **Silent Mantle Cards** - Address highest priority synergy gap
2. **Embercore Ignition Cards** - Enable Trinity of Flames viability
3. **Counter-Strategy Cards** - Provide answers for each archetype
4. **Consistency Enablers** - Add deck manipulation across all archetypes
5. **Consistency Check** - Validate all additions maintain balance
6. **Documentation Update** - Revise design rationale and strategy guides

This plan addresses all major feedback from Batch 1 while maintaining the established power level and strategic diversity of the format.
