## Issue Identification & Recommendations

### Critical Issues: 0
No cards break rules or create unbeatable strategies.

### Major Issues: 0  
No cards significantly over/under-powered for their archetype role.

### Minor Issues: 3

#### Issue 1: Silent Mantle Synergy Density
**Problem**: Fewest internal synergies (6 vs 8-12 for others)
**Impact**: May feel less cohesive than other archetypes
**Recommendation**: Add 2-3 more Intel/trap synergy cards in Batch 2

#### Issue 2: Limited Ignition Enablers  
**Problem**: Only 3 cards interact with Ignition mechanic
**Impact**: Trinity of Flames win condition may be too narrow
**Recommendation**: Add 2-3 more Ignition-matters cards in Batch 2

#### Issue 3: Desperate Gambit Power Level
**Problem**: Extreme Risk (10% success) providing 5 EP + 3 cards for 1 EP cost
**Impact**: When successful, provides overwhelming advantage
**Recommendation**: Reduce to 4 EP + 2 cards or increase cost to 2 EP

### Quality Improvement Opportunities

#### Enhanced Interaction Options
- Add more instant-speed responses for each archetype
- Create more flexible removal options
- Include counter-strategies for dominant synergies

#### Strategic Diversity Expansion
- Alternative win conditions for each archetype
- Hybrid archetype enablers
- Sideboard and meta-game options
