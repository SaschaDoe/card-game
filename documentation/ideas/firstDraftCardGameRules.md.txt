Risk & Resource: A Custom Strategic Card Game
Overview
Risk & Resource is a modular card game designed for 2–4 players featuring strategic card usage, a flexible resource system ("pitching" cards), dice-based risk-reward resolution, and bluffing mechanics. Victory is achieved through dynamic win conditions printed on cards themselves, creating evolving goals throughout the game. Players build decks from one of four archetypes or mix and match for custom play.

Core Mechanics
Resource System (Pitching)

Each card has a Pitch Value (1–3). Any card can be pitched (discarded) to gain energy points (EP) equal to its pitch value.
Energy is used to play other cards.
A pitched card is placed at the bottom of the deck (cyclical pitch mechanic) to enable late-game return.
EP has no maximum - it's purely a resource, not life.
Maximum hand size: 10 cards (discard down at end of turn)

Victory & Defeat Conditions

No life totals - instead, victory is achieved through Win Condition cards.
Win Condition cards state specific board states or achievements needed to win.
Defeat occurs when:

Your deck is empty and you must draw
You have 10+ cards in your Exile zone
An opponent's win condition targeting you is fulfilled



The Exile Pressure System

When attacked by unblocked creatures, instead of losing life, you exile cards from the top of your deck equal to the damage
This creates tension: your deck is both your resource and your life
Cards in exile are much harder to recover than graveyard cards
Some win conditions involve exiling specific cards or reaching exile thresholds


Combat System
Creature Types & Stats
All creatures have:

Power: Damage dealt in combat
Defense: Damage needed to destroy (refreshes each turn)
Speed: Fast creatures deal damage first
Type: Beast, Construct, Elemental, or Agent

Combat Phases

Declare Attackers: Tap creatures to attack (can target players or creatures)
Declare Blockers: Defending player assigns blockers
Speed Resolution: Fast creatures deal damage first
Normal Resolution: Remaining creatures deal damage
Pressure Resolution: Unblocked damage exiles cards from defender's deck

Special Combat Rules

Guardian: Must be blocked if able
Evasive: Can only be blocked by creatures with Evasive or Reach
Reach: Can block Evasive creatures
Deadly: Any damage destroys the creature
Armored X: Prevent the first X damage each turn

Why Keep Opponent's Creatures?

Some creatures have Symbiotic effects that benefit their controller
Flame Guard example: "Symbiotic - At the start of your turn, gain 2 EP"
Creates tension: useful resource vs. enabling opponent's win condition
Some creatures can be "turned" with specific cards


Enhanced Card Types
Permanent Subtypes

Creature: Can attack/block, has P/D
Artifact: Provides ongoing effects, harder to destroy
Enchantment: Modifies game rules or other permanents
Landmark: Powerful effects that affect all players
Win Condition: Special permanents that provide victory routes

Timing System

Priority: Active player has priority, passes clockwise
The Stack: Instants and abilities use last-in-first-out resolution
Response Windows:

After any card is played
Before/after combat phases
End of turn
When win conditions are checked



Action Economy

One Land/Landmark per turn (if included in deck)
Unlimited spells as long as you can pay EP
One attack phase per turn
Instant speed: Can be played anytime you have priority
Sorcery speed: Only during your main phase with empty stack


Refined Dice Risk Mechanic
Risk Levels
Instead of multiple dice, use a single d20 with scaling thresholds:

Low Risk: 6+ to succeed (75% chance)
Medium Risk: 11+ to succeed (50% chance)
High Risk: 16+ to succeed (25% chance)
Extreme Risk: 19+ to succeed (10% chance)

Risk Rewards

Critical Success (natural 20): Double the effect
Success: Normal effect
Failure by 1-2: Partial effect (if applicable)
Failure by 3+: No effect, card discarded
Critical Failure (natural 1): Opponent gains benefit


Refined Bluffing System
Trap Mechanics

Trap Limit: Maximum 2 face-down traps per player
Trap Cost: 1 EP to set any card as a trap
Trap Types:

True Trap: An instant that triggers on specific conditions
Bluff Trap: Any non-instant card set as psychological warfare
Delayed Trap: Permanents that enter play when triggered



Trap Interactions

Challenge: Pay 2 EP to force opponent to reveal a trap

If it's a bluff (non-instant), it's discarded and you draw a card
If it's real, it triggers immediately targeting the challenger


Sweep: Some cards can "sweep" all traps, forcing mass reveal
Trap Steal: Rare effects can steal face-down traps
