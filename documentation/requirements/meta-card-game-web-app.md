# Meta Card Game Web App - Requirements Document

## Project Overview

### Vision Statement
Create a universal web application in SvelteKit that can dynamically interpret any card game rules and card descriptions, transform them into playable digital experiences using LLM APIs, and provide both manual and AI-powered gameplay for any card game system from poker to Magic: The Gathering-style games.

### Core Concept
The application serves as a "meta" card game platform that can adapt to ANY card game system by:
1. **Universal Rule Parsing** - Interpret rules from simple poker to complex TCGs
2. **Adaptive Card Generation** - Convert any card description into interactive digital cards
3. **Flexible Game Engine** - Support various game types (trick-taking, deck-building, TCGs, etc.)
4. **AI-Powered Gameplay** - LLM opponents that understand any game's strategy
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility** - Save/load functionality for all game types

### Supported Game Types
- **Traditional Card Games**: Poker, Bridge, Hearts, Spades, Blackjack
- **Trading Card Games**: Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Pok√©mon
- **Living Card Games**: Android: Netrunner, Lord of the Rings LCG
- **Deck-Building Games**: Dominion, Ascension, Star Realms
- **Custom Games**: Risk & Resource and user-created systems
