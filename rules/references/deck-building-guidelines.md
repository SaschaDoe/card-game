# Risk & Resource: Deck Building Guidelines

## Basic Requirements

### Deck Size
- **Minimum:** 40 cards
- **Maximum:** No limit (but larger decks are less consistent)
- **Recommended:** 40-45 cards for consistency

### Card Limits
- **Maximum copies:** 3 of any card (except basic resources)
- **Legendary cards:** 3 copies allowed, but only 1 can be in play
- **Unique cards:** As specified on the card

## Deck Construction Formats

### 1. Constructed (Standard)
- Build from your collection
- Follow card limits above
- All cards from current sets allowed

### 2. Archetype Pure
- All cards must be from a single archetype
- Access to archetype's full card pool
- Includes neutral cards marked for that archetype

### 3. Hybrid Archetype
- Choose 2 archetypes as your base
- Can use cards from both archetypes
- Neutral cards available to either archetype

### 4. Singleton
- Maximum 1 copy of each card
- Minimum deck size: 60 cards
- More variance, longer games

### 5. Limited/Draft
- Build from a limited pool of cards
- Minimum deck size: 30 cards
- No maximum copy restrictions

## Building a Balanced Deck

### Mana Curve Considerations
```
EP Cost | Recommended Count | Purpose
--------|-------------------|----------
0-1 EP  | 8-10 cards       | Early plays, efficient removal
2-3 EP  | 12-15 cards      | Core plays, efficient creatures
4-5 EP  | 8-10 cards       | Power plays, game-changers
6+ EP   | 2-4 cards        | Finishers, bombs
```

### Pitch Value Distribution
- **High Pitch (3):** 8-10 cards - Emergency resources
- **Medium Pitch (2):** 15-20 cards - Flexible options
- **Low Pitch (1):** 10-15 cards - Efficient plays

### Card Type Balance

#### Aggressive Decks
- Creatures: 20-24
- Removal/Combat Tricks: 8-10
- Win Conditions: 2-3
- Utility/Draw: 4-5

#### Control Decks
- Creatures: 8-12
- Removal/Counters: 12-15
- Win Conditions: 3-4
- Draw/Selection: 6-8

#### Midrange Decks
- Creatures: 15-18
- Removal: 8-10
- Win Conditions: 2-3
- Utility/Value: 8-10

#### Combo Decks
- Combo Pieces: 9-12
- Protection: 8-10
- Card Selection: 10-12
- Alternative Win: 2-3

## Archetype-Specific Guidelines

- 8-10 trap-capable instants
- 10-12 evasive creatures
- 6-8 information gathering tools

- 6-8 artifact recursion
- 4-6 protection pieces
- 3-4 "Assembly Line" payoffs

## Win Condition Integration

### Primary Win Conditions (2-3 copies)
Choose win conditions that align with your strategy:
- Aggro: Damage threshold victories
- Control: Inevitable value victories
- Combo: Specific board state victories

### Backup Win Conditions (1-2 copies)
Include alternate paths to victory:
- Generic pressure win (exile 30+ cards total)
- Creature mass win (control 7+ creatures)
- Resource win (have 20+ EP)

### Protecting Win Conditions
- Include 4-6 protection spells
- Have redundant win conditions
- Include recursion for key pieces

## Sideboard Construction (15 cards)

### Core Sideboard Slots
- 3-4 additional removal for creature matchups
- 3-4 anti-control cards (counters, hand attack)
- 2-3 artifact/enchantment removal
- 2-3 graveyard interaction
- 2-3 flexible slots for meta calls

### Sideboarding Strategy
- Never dilute core strategy
- Side out high-cost cards vs aggro
- Side out removal vs control
- Maintain pitch value balance

## Common Deck Building Mistakes

### 1. Insufficient Pitch Outlets
- **Problem:** Can't generate EP when needed
- **Solution:** Ensure 30+ cards have pitch value 2+

### 2. Top-Heavy Curve
- **Problem:** Dead cards early, can't stabilize
- **Solution:** 60% of deck should cost 3 EP or less

### 3. No Card Advantage
- **Problem:** Run out of resources
- **Solution:** Include 6-8 cards that generate advantage

### 4. Inflexible Win Conditions
- **Problem:** Easily disrupted, no backup plan
- **Solution:** Multiple paths to victory

### 5. Ignoring Exile Pressure
- **Problem:** Lose to incidental damage
- **Solution:** Include exile recursion or life gain

## Advanced Deck Building Concepts

### Velocity vs Value
- **Velocity:** How quickly you execute your plan
- **Value:** How much advantage you gain over time
- Balance based on archetype and meta

### Critical Mass
Certain strategies require minimum numbers:
- Tribal: 20+ creatures of the type
- Artifacts: 18+ artifacts for Assembly Line
- Spells Matter: 20+ instants/sorceries

### Mana Efficiency
Track your EP spent per turn goals:
- Turns 1-2: Spend 1-3 EP
- Turns 3-4: Spend 3-5 EP  
- Turns 5+: Spend 5+ EP

### The 60% Rule
Your deck should execute its primary strategy successfully in 60% of games without specific draws

## Testing Your Deck

### Goldfish Games (Solo Testing)
1. Draw opening hands, evaluate keepability
2. Play out first 5 turns
3. Track average damage/board state
4. Note dead cards and pitch decisions

### Key Metrics to Track
- Average turn to deploy win condition
- Average EP generated per turn
- Number of dead cards by turn 5
- Resilience to single removal spell

### Matchup Testing Grid
Test against each archetype:
- Win rate (aim for no auto-losses)
- Key cards in each matchup
- Sideboard effectiveness
- Average game length

## Tournament Deck Registration

### Required Information
- Complete deck list (alphabetical within types)
- Sideboard list (exactly 15 cards)
- Player name and ID
- Archetype designation

### Deck Checks
Ensure your deck:
- Meets minimum size (40)
- Follows card limits (max 3)
- Matches registration sheet
- Properly sleeved (if required)
