### Timing Considerations

- Some win conditions are better late game

### Deckbuilding with Win Conditions
- 2-3 copies of primary win condition

3. **Victory Turn:** Meet requirements and win

### Countering Win Conditions
- Direct removal (destroy/exile)
- Bounce effects (temporary solution)

- Race with your own win condition
