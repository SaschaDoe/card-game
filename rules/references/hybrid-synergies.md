# Risk & Resource: Hybrid Synergies & Cross-Archetype Cards

## Overview
Hybrid cards enable strategic combinations between archetypes while maintaining each faction's distinct identity. These cards require careful consideration in deck building and create new strategic possibilities.

## Hybrid Card Design Principles

### 1. Equal Archetype Representation
- Each hybrid card equally represents both archetypes
- No hybrid should favor one archetype over another
- Abilities should feel natural to both themes

### 2. Enhanced, Not Overpowered
- Hybrid cards provide utility, not raw power
- Cost appropriately for their flexibility
- Create interesting decisions, not auto-includes

### 3. Strategic Bridge Building
- Enable new deck archetypes and strategies
- Reward players for mixing archetypes thoughtfully
- Create counterplay options for both pure and hybrid strategies

## Counter-Mechanics by Archetype

### Anti-Assembly Disruption

## Hybrid Deck Building Guidelines

### Mana Base Considerations
- Hybrid decks should run 40-45 cards for consistency
- Include extra card draw to find both archetype's pieces
- Consider higher pitch value ratios for flexibility

### Synergy Balance
- Aim for 60% archetype synergies, 40% hybrid cards
- Include cards that work with either archetype
- Don't dilute core strategies completely

### Win Condition Selection
- Include win conditions from both archetypes
- Consider hybrid win conditions when available
- Have backup plans if primary synergies are disrupted

### Sideboard Strategy
- Side in archetype-specific hate for pure decks
- Include flexible answers for hybrid mirror matches
- Consider transformational sideboards for game 2/3

## Competitive Implications

### Tournament Viability
- Hybrid decks should be viable but not dominant
- Create interesting metagame dynamics
- Reward skilled deck builders and pilots

### Format Impact
- Add strategic depth without increasing complexity
- Create more diverse tournament fields
- Enable innovative deck building approaches

### Balance Considerations
- Monitor hybrid card power levels closely
- Adjust counter-mechanics if needed
- Ensure pure archetypes remain competitive
