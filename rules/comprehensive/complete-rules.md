## 1. Game Concepts

### 1.1 Energy Points (EP)
- Energy Points are the primary resource used to play cards
- EP has no maximum limit
- EP persists between turns
- EP cannot be negative

### 1.2 Pitch System
- Any card may be pitched (discarded) to gain EP equal to its Pitch Value
- Pitch Values range from 1-3
- Pitched cards are placed on the bottom of the owner's deck in the order they were pitched
- Pitching is an instant-speed action that doesn't use the stack

### 1.3 Card Characteristics
Every card has:
- Name
- Cost (in EP)
- Type and Subtype
- Text box (abilities/effects)
- Pitch Value
- (Creatures only) Power and Defense

### 1.4 Intel Tokens
- Intel tokens are a resource generated by information-gathering effects
- Intel tokens have no maximum limit and persist between turns
- Intel tokens can be spent to activate abilities with Intel costs
- Intel abilities have escalating costs per turn:
  - 1st Intel ability used per turn: Normal cost
  - 2nd Intel ability used per turn: +2 EP additional cost
  - 3rd+ Intel ability used per turn: +4 EP additional cost
- Intel escalation resets at the beginning of each turn

#### Intel Timing and Priority
- Spending Intel tokens follows normal priority rules
- Intel abilities can be activated any time their speed allows (instant vs sorcery speed)
- Spending Intel tokens themselves doesn't use the stack (like spending EP)
- The ability purchased with Intel uses the stack normally
- Players can respond to Intel abilities the same as any other ability

### 1.5 Assembly Line
- Assembly Line is a cost reduction mechanic for artifact spells
- Artifacts with Assembly Line cost 1 EP less for each other artifact you control
- Maximum cost reduction from Assembly Line: 4 EP
- All spells have a minimum cost of 1 EP unless stated otherwise
- Assembly Line only applies when casting the spell, not to abilities

### 1.6 Cost Reduction Stacking
When multiple cost reduction effects apply to the same spell:
1. Calculate all cost increases first (additional costs, taxes, etc.)
2. Apply all cost reductions (Assembly Line, Affinity, Convoke, etc.)
3. Each reduction effect has its own maximum if specified
4. Total cost cannot be reduced below 1 EP unless the spell normally costs 0
5. Alternative costs (such as morph costs) replace the normal cost entirely and don't stack with reductions

## 2. Game Zones

### 2.1 Library (Deck)
- Face-down pile of cards
- Random order unless an effect states otherwise
- Running out of cards doesn't cause immediate loss

### 2.2 Hand
- Maximum hand size: 10 cards
- No maximum during turns, check at end phase
- Hidden information except when revealed by effects

### 2.3 Battlefield
- Public zone where permanents exist
- Cards enter untapped unless stated otherwise
- Permanents remain until destroyed, exiled, or sacrificed

### 2.4 Graveyard
- Public zone for destroyed/discarded cards
- Order matters (cards cannot be rearranged)
- Face-up unless an effect states otherwise

### 2.5 Exile
- Removed from game zone
- Cards here are difficult to interact with
- 10+ cards in exile causes loss
- Public information

### 2.6 Stack
- Zone where spells and abilities exist while resolving
- Last in, first out (LIFO) resolution
- Players can respond to items on the stack

### 2.7 Trap Zone
- Face-down cards set as traps
- Maximum 2 traps per player
- Private information until revealed

## 3. Card Types

### 3.1 Permanent Types

#### 3.1.1 Creatures
- Have Power (damage dealt) and Defense (damage to destroy)
- Can attack and block
- Defense refreshes at start of turn

2. "Until end of turn" effects from previous turn end
3. Damage marked on creatures is removed
4. No player receives priority

### 4.2 Draw Phase
1. Active player draws 2 cards
2. This draw cannot be responded to
3. If unable to draw required cards, that player loses
4. After draw, active player receives priority

### 4.3 Resource Phase

2. Active player may pitch any number of cards
3. Pitching doesn't use the stack
4. Active player receives priority

### 4.4 Main Phase 1
1. Active player may play cards at sorcery speed
2. Active player may activate abilities
3. All players may play instants when they have priority
4. Phase ends when active player passes with empty stack

### 4.5 Combat Phase

#### 4.5.1 Beginning of Combat

2. Each creature may only block one attacker
3. Multiple creatures may block the same attacker
4. Blocking triggers occur
5. Players receive priority

#### 4.5.4 Damage Resolution

**First Damage Step (Fast Creatures)**:
1. All creatures with Fast deal and receive damage simultaneously
2. Damage assignment follows normal rules (power = damage dealt)
3. State-based actions are checked: creatures with lethal damage are destroyed
4. Players do NOT receive priority during damage resolution

**Second Damage Step (Normal Speed)**:
1. All remaining creatures (without Fast) deal and receive damage simultaneously
2. This includes any creatures that survived the first damage step
3. State-based actions are checked again
4. All damage is marked on creatures (not subtracted from defense)

**Combat Trick Timing**:
- Instants and abilities can only be played between damage steps, not during them
- Priority is given after first damage step but before second damage step
- No responses allowed during actual damage dealing

#### 4.5.5 Pressure Resolution
1. For each unblocked creature that dealt damage to a player:
   - That player exiles cards from top of library equal to damage
2. This happens after all combat damage

#### 4.5.6 End of Combat
- "Until end of combat" effects end
- Players receive priority

### 4.6 Main Phase 2
- Identical to Main Phase 1

- Players receive priority between each resolution
- Stack must be empty to move phases

### 5.3 Timing Restrictions
- Sorcery Speed: Only during your main phase with empty stack
- Instant Speed: Anytime you have priority
- Special Actions (don't use stack):
  - Playing a land/landmark
  - Pitching cards
  - Turning creatures face up

## 6. Combat

### 6.1 Combat Restrictions

- Creatures cannot attack the turn they enter (unless they have haste)
- Creatures can block the turn they enter
- Each creature may only attack once per turn

### 6.2 Combat Keywords

#### 6.2.1 Speed Modifiers
- **Fast**: Deals damage in first damage step
- **Slow**: Deals damage in second damage step (default)

4. With Deadly, 1 damage is lethal

## 7. Risk Mechanics

### 7.1 Risk Resolution
When a risk effect triggers:
1. Declare the risk level (if choice exists)
2. Roll d20
3. Compare to threshold:
   - Low Risk: 6+ (75%)
   - Medium Risk: 11+ (50%)
   - High Risk: 16+ (25%)
   - Extreme Risk: 19+ (10%)

### 7.2 Risk Outcomes
- **Critical Success (Natural 20)**: Always doubles the effect if applicable, regardless of risk level
- **Success**: Normal effect occurs when meeting or exceeding threshold
- **Failure by 1-2**: Partial effect occurs if defined on the card
- **Failure by 3+**: No effect occurs
- **Critical Failure (Natural 1)**: Always triggers opponent benefit if defined, regardless of risk level

#### Universal Natural Results
- Natural 20 is always a critical success on any risk roll
- Natural 1 is always a critical failure on any risk roll  
- These universal effects apply even if the natural result would normally succeed/fail
- Card-specific critical effects stack with universal natural results

### 7.3 Risk Modifiers
Some effects modify risk rolls:
- "+X to risk rolls": Add X to the die result
- "Reduce risk level": Use next easier threshold
- "Reroll risk dice": Roll again, must use new result

## 8. Trap System

### 8.1 Setting Traps
1. Pay 1 EP
2. Place any card face-down in trap zone
3. Maximum 2 traps per player
4. Can set traps at instant speed

### 8.2 Trap Types
- **True Trap**: Instant with trap conditions
- **Bluff Trap**: Any non-instant card
- **Delayed Trap**: Permanent that enters when triggered

### 8.3 Trap Triggers
- Each trap card defines its trigger condition
- Triggers are checked continuously
- When triggered, reveal and resolve if instant

### 8.4 Challenging Traps
1. Any player may pay 2 EP to challenge
2. Target player reveals challenged trap
3. If bluff: Trap is discarded, challenger draws 1
4. If real: Trap triggers targeting challenger

### 8.5 Trap Interactions
- "Sweep" effects force all traps to be revealed
- Some effects can steal or copy traps
- Traps are not permanents or spells while face-down

## 9. Win and Loss Conditions

### 9.1 Victory Conditions
A player wins immediately when:
1. They fulfill a Win Condition card's requirements
2. All opponents have lost the game

## 11. State-Based Actions

State-based actions are checked automatically whenever a player would receive priority and are performed immediately without using the stack.

### 11.1 Complete State-Based Actions List
1. **Creature Destruction**: Creatures with damage equal to or greater than their defense are destroyed
2. **Zero Toughness**: Creatures with 0 or less defense are destroyed
3. **Exile Loss Condition**: Players with 10 or more cards in exile lose the game

5. **Win Condition Check**: All win conditions are evaluated for their victory requirements
6. **Illegal Aura Attachment**: Auras attached to illegal or nonexistent targets are destroyed
7. **Counter Cancellation**: +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters on the same permanent cancel each other out
8. **Hand Size Enforcement**: During end phase cleanup only, players discard down to maximum hand size
9. **Legend Rule**: Players controlling multiple legendary permanents with the same name choose one to keep, destroy the rest
10. **Planeswalker Uniqueness**: Players controlling multiple planeswalkers with the same subtype choose one to keep, destroy the rest

### 11.2 State-Based Action Timing
- Checked before any player receives priority
- Checked after any spell or ability resolves
- Performed immediately without using the stack
- Cannot be responded to or prevented by normal means
- If any state-based actions are performed, they are checked again until none apply

### 11.3 Multiple State-Based Actions
When multiple state-based actions would occur simultaneously:
1. They are all performed at the same time
2. The active player chooses the order for their own state-based actions
3. Non-active players choose in turn order
4. State-based actions are checked again after all are resolved

## 12. Mulligan Procedures

### 12.1 Standard Mulligan (Constructed Formats)
1. Each player draws their opening hand of 7 cards
2. Each player may take one free mulligan:
   - Shuffle hand into library, draw 7 new cards
3. Additional mulligans after the first:
   - Shuffle hand into library, draw 6 cards, then scry 1
   - Each additional mulligan draws 1 fewer card but still scry 1
4. Minimum hand size: 1 card (cannot mulligan to 0)

### 12.2 Competitive Mulligan (Tournament Play)
1. Each player draws 7 cards
2. Paris Mulligan system:
   - Shuffle hand back, draw 1 fewer card
   - Continue until satisfied or at 1 card minimum
   - No scry effects in competitive mulligan

### 12.3 Draft/Limited Mulligan
1. Each player draws 7 cards
2. Two free mulligans (draw 7 cards each time)
3. Additional mulligans follow standard rules (draw 6, scry 1, etc.)

### 12.4 Multiplayer Mulligan
1. All players decide on mulligans simultaneously
2. Reveal decisions, then resolve mulligans
3. Follow format-specific rules (Standard, Competitive, etc.)
4. Turn order is not affected by mulligan decisions

## 13. Face-Down Permanents

### 13.1 Basic Face-Down Rules
- Face-down permanents are 2/2 colorless creatures with no abilities
- They have no name, mana cost, or other characteristics
- Face-down permanents can be turned face-up by paying their morph cost
- Only the controller knows what the face-down permanent actually is

### 13.2 Playing Cards Face-Down
- Cards with morph can be played face-down as 2/2 creatures for 3 EP
- Face-down permanents enter the battlefield tapped unless stated otherwise
- Any card can be set as a trap face-down for 1 EP (different from morph)

### 13.3 Face-Down Interactions
- Spells and abilities that target "creature" can target face-down creatures
- Effects that care about creature type, color, or other characteristics don't apply to face-down permanents
- When face-down permanents change zones, they are briefly revealed to all players
- Clone effects copying face-down permanents copy the face-down status and 2/2 characteristics

### 13.4 Turning Face-Up
- Pay the morph cost at any time you have priority
- Creature becomes face-up immediately (doesn't use the stack)
- All characteristics become those of the actual card
- Turning face-up doesn't trigger "enters the battlefield" abilities

### 13.5 Face-Down Permanent Death
- When a face-down permanent would be destroyed or exiled, reveal it briefly
- It goes to the appropriate zone face-up
- Any "when this dies" triggers use the actual card's characteristics
