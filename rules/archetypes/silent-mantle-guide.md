## Advanced Techniques

### The Bluff Cascade
Set multiple bluff traps to make opponents question every face-down card, even your real traps.

### Intel Banking
Save Intel tokens for critical turns rather than spending them immediately. 6+ Intel threatens game-ending plays.

### Trap Recycling
Use bounce effects on your own revealed traps to reset them, generating more value and confusion.

### Information Asymmetry
Use knowledge of opponent's hand to make "risky" plays that aren't actually risky.

### Counter Baiting
Show weakness to bait important spells, then counter them for massive tempo swings.

## Common Mistakes

### Over-Trapping
Don't set traps just because you can. Each trap costs 1 EP and a card.

### Intel Waste
Spending Intel tokens too early for minimal advantage instead of saving for backbreaking plays.

### Predictable Patterns
Setting traps in obvious situations makes them easy to play around.

### Neglecting Pressure
Pure control without threats gives opponents time to recover.

### Information Paralysis
Having perfect information but failing to act on it decisively.

## The Silent Mantle Lore

*"In the courts of the Silent Mantle, words are weapons and secrets are currency. They teach that every piece of information has value, every hidden truth a price. Their agents move through shadows, gathering intelligence that topples kingdoms.*

*The Mantle's libraries contain not books, but crystallized thoughts - the stolen secrets of a thousand enemies. Their greatest masters can read an opponent's intent before they themselves know it, turning strength against itself.*

*Their maxim: 'What is unknown cannot be countered. What is known cannot threaten.'"*
