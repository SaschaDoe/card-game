# Risk & Resource: Quick Start Guide

## Game Overview
Risk & Resource is a strategic card game for 2-4 players where you manage energy, take calculated risks, and pursue dynamic victory conditions. Games typically last 20-40 minutes.

## How to Win
- Achieve any **Win Condition** card's requirements
- Be the last player standing (opponents lose by running out of cards or having 10+ exiled cards)

## Core Concepts

### Energy Points (EP)
- Your main resource for playing cards
- Start with 5 EP, gain 1 EP each turn
- **Pitch** any card (discard to bottom of deck) to gain EP equal to its Pitch Value (1-3)

### The Exile Zone
- When creatures damage you, exile that many cards from your deck
- 10+ exiled cards = you lose
- Exiled cards are very hard to recover

### Card Types
- **Creatures**: Attack/block, have Power/Defense
- **Instants**: Play anytime you have priority
- **Sorceries**: Play only on your turn
- **Permanents**: Stay on the battlefield (Artifacts, Enchantments, Landmarks)
- **Win Conditions**: Special permanents that let you win

## Turn Structure
1. **Untap** - Ready all your cards
2. **Draw** - Draw 2 cards
3. **Resource** - Gain 1 EP, pitch cards for more
4. **Main Phase 1** - Play cards, activate abilities
5. **Combat** - Attack with creatures
6. **Main Phase 2** - Play more cards
7. **End** - Discard to 10 cards, check win conditions

## Combat Basics
1. Declare which creatures attack (tap them)
2. Opponent assigns blockers
3. **Fast** creatures deal damage first
4. Normal creatures deal damage
5. Unblocked damage exiles cards from defender's deck

## Risk Dice (d20)
Some cards have risk effects:
- **Low Risk**: 6+ succeeds (75%)
- **Medium Risk**: 11+ succeeds (50%) 
- **High Risk**: 16+ succeeds (25%)
- **Natural 20**: Critical success!
- **Natural 1**: Critical failure!

## Traps & Bluffing
- Pay 1 EP to place any card face-down as a trap (max 2)
- Instants trigger when conditions are met
- Non-instants are bluffs for mind games
- Opponents can pay 2 EP to challenge your traps

## First Game Setup
1. Each player needs a 40-card deck
2. Shuffle and draw 7 cards
3. One free mulligan allowed
4. Start with 5 EP
5. Roll dice for first player

## Basic Strategy Tips
